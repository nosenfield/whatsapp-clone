# Product Context: WhatsApp Clone

## What Problem Are We Solving?

### Primary Use Case
Enable fast, reliable, real-time messaging between iOS users with a focus on offline functionality and future AI assistance.

### Core Problems Addressed
1. **Slow Message Delivery**: Messages should appear instantly (<300ms)
2. **Offline Limitations**: Users should access full chat history without network
3. **No Presence Awareness**: Users can't see who's online/typing
4. **Limited Media Support**: Can't share images in conversations
5. **Poor Group Experience**: No group chats or proper multi-user handling
6. **No Push Alerts**: Users miss messages when app is closed

## How It Should Work

### User Journey: Starting a Conversation
1. **Sign Up**: Create account with email/password (< 2 minutes)
2. **Discover Users**: Search by email or display name
3. **Start Chat**: Tap contact, open conversation screen
4. **Send Message**: Type and send - appears instantly
5. **Receive Message**: Real-time delivery with status indicators
6. **Go Offline**: Messages queue, auto-send when reconnected

### User Journey: Using AI Features (Future)
1. **Ask Question**: "What did we discuss about the meeting?"
2. **AI Responds**: Searches conversation history (RAG)
3. **Contextual Answer**: Based on past messages
4. **Translation**: "Translate this to Spanish"
5. **Summarization**: "Summarize last 10 messages"

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Decisions
1. **React Native + Expo**: Faster than learning Swift, enables Android later
2. **TypeScript Strict**: Catch errors at compile time
3. **Dual Database**: Firestore for persistence, RTDB for speed
4. **SQLite Caching**: Offline-first, instant loads
5. **Optimistic UI**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server

### Why These Choices

**React Native over Swift**
- Leverage existing TypeScript expertise
- Faster development cycle
- Enable Android in future with minimal effort
- Mature ecosystem with Firebase support

**Dual Database Strategy**
- RTDB: Ultra-low latency for typing/presence
- Firestore: Complex queries and message history
- Cost optimization for high-frequency ephemeral writes
- Automatic connection state management (RTDB)

**Offline-First with SQLite**
- Messages work without network
- App launches instantly (no network wait)
- Queue outbound messages when offline
- Sync when reconnected automatically

**Optimistic UI Pattern**
- Messages appear instantly (better UX)
- Status updates show real delivery state
- Failed sends can be retried
- No perceived lag for users

## Value Proposition

### For End Users
- **Fast**: Messages appear instantly
- **Reliable**: Works offline, syncs automatically
