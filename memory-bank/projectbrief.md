# Project Brief: WhatsApp Clone with AI Layer

## Core Purpose

Build a production-ready iOS messaging application (MVP) that demonstrates modern mobile development practices while establishing a foundation for AI integration. The app should feel native, perform well, and be ready for alpha testing with 5-100 users.

## Key Requirements

### MVP Requirements (Must Have)
1. **User Authentication**: Email/password sign up and sign in with persistence
2. **Real-Time Messaging**: One-on-one and group chat (up to 20 users) with <300ms delivery
3. **Offline Support**: Full functionality without network connection, message queuing
4. **Media Sharing**: Image upload and display with compression
5. **Presence & Typing**: Online/offline indicators and typing indicators
6. **Push Notifications**: iOS notifications when app is backgrounded/closed
7. **Production Polish**: Error handling, network states, smooth animations

### AI Layer (Post-MVP)
8. **AI Assistance**: Conversation summarization, smart replies, translation
9. **RAG Pipeline**: Embed conversation history for context-aware AI queries
10. **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout of AI capabilities

## Target Audience

- **Alpha Testers**: 5-100 iOS users for initial validation
- **Future**: Expand to Android and broader user base
- **AI Features**: Targeted at parent-caregiver communication (see appendix B)

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- Message delivery <300ms (online)
- Presence updates <50ms
- App launch <3s
- 60 FPS scroll performance
- Full offline functionality
- No memory leaks
- TypeScript strict mode (zero `any`)

### User Experience Metrics
- Users can sign up in <2 minutes
- Real-time messaging feels instant
- Offline messages sync when back online
- Push notifications deliver within 5 seconds
- No critical bugs during alpha testing

### Business Metrics
- 5-100 active alpha testers
- >80% user retention after 1 week
- <2% crash rate
- TestFlight deployment successful

## Constraints

### Technical
- iOS only for MVP (React Native makes Android easy for Phase 2)
- Maximum 20 users per group chat
- TypeScript strict mode enforced
- Firebase free tier initially (scale as needed)
- Physical iOS device required for push testing

### Business
- 1-person development team
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks for MVP
- Alpha testing phase: 2-4 weeks
- Cost control: Monitor Firebase usage daily

### Scope Exclusions (Not in MVP)
- ❌ Voice messages
- ❌ Video messages
- ❌ End-to-end encryption
- ❌ Message reactions/emojis
- ❌ Story/status feature
- ❌ Calls (voice/video)
- ❌ Android version
- ❌ Advanced AI features (Phase 7)

## Development Philosophy

1. **Stability over Speed**: Working code beats fast broken code
2. **Offline First**: App must work without internet connection
3. **Optimistic UI**: Messages appear instantly, sync in background
4. **Security First**: Proper Firebase rules, no exposed secrets
5. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript to catch errors early
6. **User Feedback**: Alpha testing to validate real-world usage

## Architecture Principles

1. **Dual Database Strategy**: Firestore for persistence, RTDB for speed
2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Firebase logic separated from UI
3. **React Query + Zustand**: Server state vs client state
4. **Custom Hooks**: Reusable business logic
5. **Optimistic Updates**: SQLite for instant UI feedback
6. **Modular Cloud Functions**: Separate concerns (notifications, AI, etc.)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Push notifications complex**: Use Expo service (simpler than FCM)
- **Real-time sync issues**: Comprehensive testing with 2+ users
- **Firebase costs**: Monitor usage, implement pagination
- **Memory leaks**: Use React DevTools, test with 100+ messages

### Business Risks
- **Scope creep**: Strictly follow task-list.md sequentially
- **Timeline delays**: Focus on core features, defer polish items
- **User adoption**: Enlist 5 enthusiastic alpha testers first

## Success Indicators

**Phase Complete When:**
- ✅ All tasks marked complete in task-list.md
- ✅ No critical bugs in testing
- ✅ TestFlight deployed successfully
- ✅ Alpha testers can use all core features
- ✅ Firebase costs within budget

**MVP Complete When:**
- ✅ 5-100 active users
- ✅ <2% crash rate
- ✅ All features working reliably
- ✅ Feedback collected and prioritized
- ✅ Ready for Phase 7 (AI) or Android

## Next Steps After MVP

1. **AI Integration** (Phase 7): Add conversation summarization, smart replies
2. **Polish** (Phase 6 completion): Full UX refinement
3. **Android**: Port to Android using existing React Native code
4. **Scale**: Optimize for 1000+ users
5. **Advanced Features**: Voice/video, reactions, stories
