# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Session Status

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Phase**: Phase 7 - AI Integration (Tool Improvements)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Code Complete - Deployment Pending  

## What We're Working On NOW

### AI Tool Improvements Complete
Just completed comprehensive AI assistant improvements:

1. ‚úÖ **New `analyze_conversation` tool** - Extracts specific information from conversations
2. ‚úÖ **RAG integration** - Semantic search across conversation history
3. ‚úÖ **Enhanced system prompt** - Pattern 3 for information extraction
4. ‚úÖ **Pre-flight validation** - Catches invalid commands early
5. ‚úÖ **Enhanced parameter validation** - Better error handling
6. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive test suite** - 100% pass rate (11/11 tests)

## Recent Changes and Decisions

### AI Tool Improvements Implemented
- **New Tool**: `analyze_conversation` for information extraction queries
- **RAG Integration**: Semantic search with fallback to recent messages
- **Prompt Optimization**: Pattern 3 added for information extraction
- **Validation**: Pre-flight and enhanced parameter validation
- **Testing**: 100% pass rate on 11 comprehensive test cases

### Key Technical Decisions
- **RAG Primary, Fallback Secondary**: Use semantic search first, supplement with recent messages if needed
- **Context-Aware Prompting**: Different patterns based on user's current screen
- **Query Classification**: Explicit guide helps AI choose correct pattern
- **Pre-Flight Validation**: Catch errors before expensive AI API calls

## Current Project State Analysis

### From Git Status and File Review
The project appears to be well-established with:

**‚úÖ Completed Phases (1-5)**:
- Authentication system working
- Real-time messaging implemented  
- Presence and typing indicators active
- Group chats and media sharing functional
- Push notifications deployed and working

**üéØ Current Phase 6 (Polish & Testing)**:
- Basic functionality complete
- Now focusing on UX refinement and production readiness
- Some context files were deleted (need to understand why)

**üîÑ Recent Activity**:
- Several context summary files were deleted
- Memory bank files were deleted (now restored)
- Some modifications to AI processor and conversation components
- Appears to be in cleanup/reorganization phase

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Deploy AI Improvements (PENDING USER ACTION)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Run `firebase login --reauth` to authenticate
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Run `firebase deploy --only functions` to deploy
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Verify deployment successful
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Test with real conversations

### 2. Production Testing
- Test Pattern 3 (information extraction) in real conversations
- Verify RAG integration finds relevant messages
- Confirm pre-flight validation catches invalid commands
- Monitor logs for errors

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Track success rates vs projections (target: 90%+ for 2-step chains)
- Monitor prompt token usage (target: ~500 tokens, down from ~1200)
- Collect user feedback on AI responses
- Identify edge cases for improvement

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Philosophy
- **Complete Context**: Every session starts with full project understanding
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Files build upon each other logically
- **AI-Optimized**: Designed for AI assistant consumption and updates
- **Version Controlled**: Memory bank files are part of the codebase

### Development Approach
- **Sequential Execution**: Follow task-list.md order strictly
- **Quality Over Speed**: Working code beats fast broken code  
- **Ask Before Acting**: When uncertain, stop and clarify
- **Document Everything**: Context summaries after every task

### Current Constraints
- iOS only for MVP (Android later)
- TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)
- Firebase free tier (monitor usage)
- Physical device required for push testing
- 20-user group limit for MVP

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Project Status**: What's the actual current state vs task-list.md?
2. **Recent Changes**: Why were context files deleted? Any issues to address?
3. **Priority Focus**: Which Phase 6 tasks should we tackle first?
4. **AI Integration**: When to start Phase 7 preparation?
5. **Testing Status**: What testing has been done? What's needed?

## Context for AI Assistant

### How to Use This Memory Bank
1. **Always start** by reading activeContext.md (this file) and progress.md
2. **Reference hierarchy**: projectbrief ‚Üí productContext ‚Üí systemPatterns ‚Üí techContext
3. **Update activeContext.md** when work focus changes
4. **Create context summaries** after completing tasks
5. **Ask questions** when memory bank info conflicts with current state

### Key Project Principles
- **Offline-first**: App must work without network
- **Optimistic UI**: Messages appear instantly, sync in background  
- **Type safety**: TypeScript strict mode enforced
- **Security**: Firebase rules protect all data
- **Performance**: 60 FPS, <3s launch, <300ms message delivery

### Critical Files to Know
- `_docs/task-list.md`: Sequential implementation guide
- `_docs/architecture.md`: Technical architecture decisions
- `mobile/src/types/index.ts`: TypeScript type definitions
- `functions/src/index.ts`: Cloud Functions entry point
- `mobile/app/_layout.tsx`: App initialization and routing

**Next Update**: After creating progress.md and assessing current project status  
**Last Updated**: October 26, 2025 - Memory Bank Initialization  
**Version**: 1.0
