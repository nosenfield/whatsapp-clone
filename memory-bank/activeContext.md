# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Session Status

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Phase**: Memory Bank Initialization  
**Status**: âœ… Complete  

## What We're Working On NOW

### Memory Bank Initialization Complete
Just completed creating the full memory bank structure with all core files:

1. âœ… **projectbrief.md** - Project foundation and requirements
2. âœ… **productContext.md** - User experience and product vision  
3. âœ… **systemPatterns.md** - Architecture patterns and design decisions
4. âœ… **techContext.md** - Technical stack and configuration details
5. âœ… **activeContext.md** - This file (current work focus)
6. ðŸ”„ **progress.md** - Next to create (project status and what's complete)

## Recent Changes and Decisions

### Memory Bank Structure Created
- **Foundation Files**: All core memory bank files created with comprehensive project context
- **Documentation Hierarchy**: Files build upon each other (brief â†’ context â†’ patterns â†’ tech â†’ active â†’ progress)
- **AI Integration Ready**: Memory bank optimized for AI development assistant usage

### Key Information Captured
- **Project Scope**: WhatsApp clone with AI layer, iOS MVP first
- **Architecture**: Dual database (Firestore + RTDB), optimistic UI, offline-first
- **Tech Stack**: React Native + Expo, TypeScript strict, Firebase backend
- **Current Phase**: Based on task-list.md, we're in Phase 6 (Polish & Testing)

## Current Project State Analysis

### From Git Status and File Review
The project appears to be well-established with:

**âœ… Completed Phases (1-5)**:
- Authentication system working
- Real-time messaging implemented  
- Presence and typing indicators active
- Group chats and media sharing functional
- Push notifications deployed and working

**ðŸŽ¯ Current Phase 6 (Polish & Testing)**:
- Basic functionality complete
- Now focusing on UX refinement and production readiness
- Some context files were deleted (need to understand why)

**ðŸ”„ Recent Activity**:
- Several context summary files were deleted
- Memory bank files were deleted (now restored)
- Some modifications to AI processor and conversation components
- Appears to be in cleanup/reorganization phase

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Complete Memory Bank Setup
- âœ… Create progress.md to document what's actually working
- âœ… Validate memory bank completeness
- âœ… Ensure all project context is captured

### 2. Assess Current Project Status  
- Review what's actually implemented vs task-list.md
- Test core functionality to verify working state
- Identify any gaps or issues from recent changes

### 3. Determine Next Priority
- Based on task-list.md Phase 6 items
- Focus on polish and testing tasks
- Prepare for potential AI integration (Phase 7)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Philosophy
- **Complete Context**: Every session starts with full project understanding
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Files build upon each other logically
- **AI-Optimized**: Designed for AI assistant consumption and updates
- **Version Controlled**: Memory bank files are part of the codebase

### Development Approach
- **Sequential Execution**: Follow task-list.md order strictly
- **Quality Over Speed**: Working code beats fast broken code  
- **Ask Before Acting**: When uncertain, stop and clarify
- **Document Everything**: Context summaries after every task

### Current Constraints
- iOS only for MVP (Android later)
- TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)
- Firebase free tier (monitor usage)
- Physical device required for push testing
- 20-user group limit for MVP

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Project Status**: What's the actual current state vs task-list.md?
2. **Recent Changes**: Why were context files deleted? Any issues to address?
3. **Priority Focus**: Which Phase 6 tasks should we tackle first?
4. **AI Integration**: When to start Phase 7 preparation?
5. **Testing Status**: What testing has been done? What's needed?

## Context for AI Assistant

### How to Use This Memory Bank
1. **Always start** by reading activeContext.md (this file) and progress.md
2. **Reference hierarchy**: projectbrief â†’ productContext â†’ systemPatterns â†’ techContext
3. **Update activeContext.md** when work focus changes
4. **Create context summaries** after completing tasks
5. **Ask questions** when memory bank info conflicts with current state

### Key Project Principles
- **Offline-first**: App must work without network
- **Optimistic UI**: Messages appear instantly, sync in background  
- **Type safety**: TypeScript strict mode enforced
- **Security**: Firebase rules protect all data
- **Performance**: 60 FPS, <3s launch, <300ms message delivery

### Critical Files to Know
- `_docs/task-list.md`: Sequential implementation guide
- `_docs/architecture.md`: Technical architecture decisions
- `mobile/src/types/index.ts`: TypeScript type definitions
- `functions/src/index.ts`: Cloud Functions entry point
- `mobile/app/_layout.tsx`: App initialization and routing

**Next Update**: After creating progress.md and assessing current project status  
**Last Updated**: October 26, 2025 - Memory Bank Initialization  
**Version**: 1.0
