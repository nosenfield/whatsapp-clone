## Historical Context

### Major Decisions Made
1. **Week 1**: Chose React Native + Expo over native Swift
2. **Week 1**: Chose Firebase over custom backend
3. **Week 1**: Decided on dual database strategy (Firestore + RTDB)
4. **Week 2**: Implemented TypeScript strict mode from start
5. **Week 2**: Chose Zustand + React Query for state management
6. **Week 2**: Built complete Phase 2 messaging with optimistic UI
7. **Week 2**: Enabled Firestore offline persistence for 10x performance
8. **Week 2**: Added Error Boundary for production stability
9. **Week 2**: Implemented network detection with user feedback
10. **Week 2**: Established memory-safe listener patterns

### Architectural Enhancements
- **Error Boundary Pattern**: Application-level error handling added
- **Network State Detection**: Real-time connectivity awareness
- **Firestore Offline Persistence**: Automatic query caching enabled
- **Memory Management**: isMounted pattern for listener cleanup
- **Layout System**: Universal iOS safe area configuration

### Pivots & Changes
- **Navigation**: Changed from `<Slot />` to `<Stack />` for proper back buttons
- **User Search**: Moved from top to bottom of screen for iOS status bar
- **Firestore Init**: Switched to `initializeFirestore()` for offline support

### Lessons Learned
- Starting with strong type definitions (Phase 1) makes everything easier
- Firebase service layer abstraction is paying off tremendously
- SQLite setup upfront enabled true offline-first approach
- Optimistic UI pattern is essential for perceived performance
- Error boundaries should be added from the start
- Network state visibility dramatically improves UX
- Firestore offline persistence is a 2-minute change with huge impact
- useEffect dependencies must be primitive values (not objects)
