## Historical Context

### Major Decisions Made
1. **Week 1**: Chose React Native + Expo over native Swift
2. **Week 1**: Chose Firebase over custom backend
3. **Week 1**: Decided on dual database strategy (Firestore + RTDB)
4. **Week 2**: Implemented TypeScript strict mode from start
5. **Week 2**: Chose Zustand + React Query for state management

### Pivots & Changes
- None yet (still on original plan)

### Lessons Learned
- Starting with strong type definitions (Phase 1) makes everything easier
- Firebase service layer abstraction is paying off
- SQLite setup upfront will enable offline-first approach
