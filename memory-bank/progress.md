## Known Issues and Technical Debt

### Current Issues
1. **Context Files Deleted**: Recent cleanup removed context summaries and memory bank files (now restored)
2. **UI Polish Needed**: Basic functionality works but needs visual refinement
3. **Performance Testing**: Need to test with 100+ messages and multiple users
4. **Accessibility**: VoiceOver and accessibility features not implemented

### Technical Debt
1. **Console Logs**: Many debug logs still present (need cleanup)
2. **Error Messages**: Some error messages not user-friendly
3. **Loading States**: Some components lack proper loading indicators
4. **Image Optimization**: Could be more aggressive with compression

### Testing Gaps
1. **Multi-User Testing**: Need systematic testing with 3+ users
2. **Edge Cases**: Network interruption scenarios
