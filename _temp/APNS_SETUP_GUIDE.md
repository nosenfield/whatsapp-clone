## Part 4: Update Bundle Identifier in Your Code

Before building, ensure your `app.json` matches Apple Developer settings:

1. Open `/mobile/app.json`
2. Find `ios.bundleIdentifier`
3. Update to match your Apple Developer App ID:
   ```json
   "ios": {
     "supportsTablet": false,
     "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.whatsappclone"
   }
   ```
   
   **Replace `yourcompany` with your actual company name or username**
   
4. If you already have builds with the old identifier, you may want to keep it the same

## Part 5: Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to code implementation, verify:

- ‚úÖ APNs Authentication Key created in Apple Developer Portal
- ‚úÖ Key file (`.p8`) downloaded and saved securely
- ‚úÖ Key ID and Team ID recorded
- ‚úÖ App Identifier registered with Push Notifications enabled
- ‚úÖ APNs key uploaded to Firebase Console
- ‚úÖ Firebase shows "Configured" status for APNs
- ‚úÖ Bundle identifier matches in:
  - Apple Developer Portal (App ID)
  - Firebase Console (iOS app)
  - Your code (`app.json`)

---

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to upload key"
- **Solution**: Make sure the `.p8` file is the original downloaded file (not renamed or modified)
- **Solution**: Verify Key ID and Team ID are exactly as shown in Apple Developer Portal

### Issue: "Invalid Team ID"
- **Solution**: Team ID is found in Apple Developer Portal under your account name (top right)
- **Solution**: It's also shown on the Keys page when you view your key details

### Issue: "Cannot find App ID"
- **Solution**: Make sure you created an App Identifier (not a different identifier type)
- **Solution**: Verify you're in the correct team/account in Apple Developer Portal

### Issue: Bundle identifier mismatch
- **Solution**: All three locations must have the EXACT same bundle ID:
  1. Apple Developer Portal (App ID)
  2. Firebase Console (iOS app)
  3. Your code (`app.json`)

## Next Steps

Once you've completed all steps above and verified the checklist, you're ready to:
1. ‚úÖ Implement notification code in the app
2. ‚úÖ Create Cloud Functions for sending notifications
3. ‚úÖ Build the app with EAS Build
4. ‚úÖ Test on your physical iPhone

## Security Best Practices

üîí **Keep Secure:**

- Key ID and Team ID (store in password manager)

üîí **Add to `.gitignore`:**

*.p8
.env.local
```

üîí **Never expose:**
- Your APNs key in client code
- Your Firebase server key in client code
