## Action 2: Create `.cursor/rules/` Migration

**Status:** READY TO START

### Overview

Migrate workflow rules from legacy `.cursorrules` file to modern `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` structure while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Strategy

**Phase 1: Create `.cursor/rules/` directory structure**
```
.cursor/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base.mdc              # Core project overview
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow.mdc          # Development workflow rules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns.mdc          # Code patterns and standards

# Code Quality Standards

## TypeScript Standards
[Extract from .cursorrules]

## File Organization
[Extract from .cursorrules]

## Performance Guidelines
[Extract from .cursorrules]
```

### Migration Steps

1. **Create directory structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .cursor/rules
   ```

2. **Create base.mdc**
   - Extract core context from projectbrief.md
   - Add references to memory-bank files
   - Keep concise (500-800 words)

3. **Create workflow.mdc**
   - Extract workflow rules from .cursorrules
   - Preserve all ask-before-acting logic
   - Maintain commit approval requirements
   - Keep status indicator system

4. **Create patterns.mdc**
   - Extract code quality rules from .cursorrules
   - Add TypeScript standards
   - Include performance guidelines
   - Reference systemPatterns.md for details

5. **Create README.md in .cursor/rules/**
   - Explain the rules system
   - Document how to use each file
   - Reference memory-bank relationship

### Backward Compatibility

**Keep `.cursorrules` as orchestrator:**
- Update to reference new .cursor/rules/ files
- Maintain as entry point for AI
- Add clear pointers to memory-bank
- Don't delete (legacy support)

### Testing Plan

1. Create new rules files
2. Update .cursorrules to reference them
3. Test that AI reads both systems
4. Verify no conflicts
5. Monitor for 2-3 sessions
6. Adjust based on usage

---

## Action 3: Update `.cursorrules` Reference

**Status:** READY TO START (after Action 2)

### Overview

Update the legacy `.cursorrules` file to reference both the memory-bank system and the new `.cursor/rules/` files.

### Changes to Make

**Add at top of `.cursorrules`:**

```markdown
# AI Development Rules for Cursor IDE

## üéØ MOST IMPORTANT RULE - Read This First

**Before doing ANYTHING else in this project, you MUST:**

1. **Read the Memory Bank** (AI context persistence system):
   - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - What we're working on NOW
   - `memory-bank/progress.md` - What's done, what's next
   
2. **Read Core Documentation** (if first time or need reorientation):
   - `_docs/README.md` - Project overview and quick reference
   - `_docs/architecture.md` - Technical architecture
   - `_docs/task-list.md` - Sequential implementation tasks

3. **Reference Cursor Rules** (modern rule system):
   - `.cursor/rules/base.mdc` - Project context
   - `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` - Process and workflow
   - `.cursor/rules/patterns.mdc` - Code standards

---

## Memory Bank System

This project uses a **Memory Bank** for AI session continuity. The AI's memory resets between sessions, so the Memory Bank serves as the "external memory" that persists.

### Memory Bank Files (CRITICAL)

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `activeContext.md` | Current work focus, recent changes | Every session |
| `progress.md` | Completed work, what's next | After milestones |
| `projectbrief.md` | Core project goals and constraints | Rarely changes |
| `productContext.md` | Why this exists, user flows | Rarely changes |
| `systemPatterns.md` | Architecture patterns | When patterns evolve |
| `techContext.md` | Tech stack, setup | When tech changes |

### When to Update Memory Bank

Trigger **update memory bank** to review and update all files when:
- Completing significant work
- Making architectural decisions
- Starting new phase
- Context needs clarification

---

[Rest of .cursorrules content stays the same]
```

### Additional Updates

**In "Project Context Documents" section:**
```markdown
## Project Context Documents

**Memory Bank (Session Continuity):**
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current work focus (read FIRST)
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Progress tracking (read FIRST)
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Project foundation
- `memory-bank/productContext.md` - Product goals
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture patterns
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Tech stack

**Comprehensive Documentation:**
- `_docs/README.md` - Project overview, getting started
- `_docs/architecture.md` - System architecture, data models
- `_docs/task-list.md` - Detailed task breakdown

**Modern Rules System:**
- `.cursor/rules/base.mdc` - Core project context
- `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` - Development workflow
- `.cursor/rules/patterns.mdc` - Code standards

**When to read them:**
- **Memory Bank** - EVERY session start
- **README.md** - When confused about structure
- **architecture.md** - Before implementing features
- **task-list.md** - At start of each task
```

---

## Testing & Validation

### Test Scenarios

1. **New Session Test**
   - Start fresh session
   - Verify AI reads memory-bank files
   - Check understanding of current context

2. **Task Execution Test**
   - Request a task from Phase 2
   - Verify AI follows workflow rules
   - Check commit approval process

3. **Context Update Test**
   - Complete a task
   - Trigger "update memory bank"
   - Verify all relevant files updated

4. **Pattern Reference Test**
   - Request code following patterns
   - Verify AI references systemPatterns.md
   - Check code quality maintained

### Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ AI reads memory-bank at session start
- ‚úÖ AI follows workflow rules from .cursor/rules/
- ‚úÖ AI references patterns when coding
- ‚úÖ No confusion about file locations
- ‚úÖ Smooth session-to-session continuity
- ‚úÖ Commit approval still enforced

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

1. **Keep `.cursorrules` unchanged** - it still works
2. **Memory bank is additive** - doesn't break anything
3. **`.cursor/rules/` is optional** - can ignore if problematic

**To rollback:**
- Remove reference to memory-bank from .cursorrules
- Delete .cursor/rules/ directory
- Continue with original .cursorrules only

---

## Timeline

| Action | Status | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Action 1: Memory Bank Files | ‚úÖ Complete | Done |
| Action 2: Create .cursor/rules/ | ‚è≥ Next | Today |
| Action 3: Update .cursorrules | ‚è≥ After Action 2 | Today |
| Testing | ‚è≥ After Action 3 | Today |
| Monitoring | üîú Ongoing | Next week |

## Notes & Observations

### What Went Well (Action 1)
- ‚úÖ Memory bank files generated successfully
- ‚úÖ Good extraction from existing docs
- ‚úÖ activeContext.md accurately reflects current state
- ‚úÖ progress.md provides clear milestone tracking

### Potential Issues to Watch
- File size of systemPatterns.md (3000+ words) - may want to split
- Overlap between systemPatterns.md and architecture.md
- Need to establish update cadence for activeContext.md

### Questions for User
None at this stage - ready to proceed with Action 2.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Proceed with Action 2**: Create `.cursor/rules/` directory and files
2. **Extract content**: Pull relevant sections from .cursorrules
3. **Test integration**: Verify AI can use both systems
4. **Update references**: Modify .cursorrules top section
5. **Monitor usage**: Watch for 2-3 sessions to validate
