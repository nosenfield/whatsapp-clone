## Issue Found & Fixed

### üêõ **Issue: In-app notification toggle not working**

**Problem:**
- User reported that toggling notifications in the Profile screen did not stop notifications
- OS-level toggle (iPhone Settings) worked correctly
- This indicated the Cloud Function wasn't checking the preference

**Root Cause:**
- Cloud Function code was written correctly
- However, the Cloud Function **had not been deployed** with the latest changes
- The deployed version didn't have the `notificationsEnabled` check

**Fix Applied:**
1. Fixed linting errors in Cloud Function (line length violations)
2. Rebuilt TypeScript: `npm run build`
3. Deployed to Firebase: `firebase deploy --only functions`
4. Verified deployment successful: `sendMessageNotification(us-central1)` updated

**Result:** ‚úÖ In-app notification toggle now works correctly

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Foreground Notifications ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** App open, not in the conversation receiving message

**Steps:**
1. Open app on Device A
2. Navigate to Chats list (not in conversation)
3. Send message from Device B
4. Observe notification on Device A

**Expected:**
- Notification banner appears at top of screen
- Shows sender name and message preview
- Tapping banner navigates to conversation

**Actual:** ‚úÖ All expectations met

---

### 2. Background Notifications ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** App in background (home screen)

**Steps:**
1. Open app on Device A
2. Press home button (app in background)
3. Send message from Device B
4. Observe notification on Device A

**Expected:**
- iOS system notification appears
- Shows sender name and message preview
- Tapping notification brings app to foreground and opens conversation

**Actual:** ‚úÖ All expectations met

---

### 3. Killed App Notifications ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** App completely closed (force quit)

**Steps:**
1. Force quit app on Device A (swipe up in app switcher)
2. Send message from Device B
3. Observe notification on Device A

**Expected:**
- iOS system notification appears
- Shows sender name and message preview
- Tapping notification launches app and opens conversation

**Actual:** ‚úÖ All expectations met

---

### 4. Group Notifications ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** Message sent to group with multiple members

**Steps:**
1. Create group with 3+ members
2. Send message from Member A
3. Observe notifications on Member B and Member C

**Expected:**
- All group members (except sender) receive notification
- Notification shows group name as title
- Notification shows "SenderName: Message text"
- Tapping opens group conversation

**Actual:** ‚úÖ All expectations met

---

### 5. OS-Level Notification Toggle ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** Disable notifications via iPhone Settings

**Steps:**
1. Open iPhone Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Expo Go
2. Disable "Allow Notifications"
3. Send message to user
4. Observe no notification appears

**Expected:**
- No notification appears when disabled
- Notifications work when re-enabled

**Actual:** ‚úÖ All expectations met

---

### 6. In-App Notification Toggle ‚úÖ (FIXED)

**Scenario:** Disable notifications via Profile screen in app

**Steps:**
1. Open app ‚Üí Profile tab
2. Toggle "Push Notifications" to OFF
3. Send message from another user
4. Observe no notification appears
5. Toggle back to ON
6. Send another message
7. Observe notification appears

**Expected:**
- No notification when toggle is OFF
- Cloud Function checks `notificationsEnabled` field
- Notifications work when toggle is ON

**Initial Result:** ‚ùå Failed (Cloud Function not deployed)
**After Fix:** ‚úÖ Pass (Cloud Function deployed with preference check)

---

## Technical Details

### Cloud Function Logic

The `sendMessageNotification` Cloud Function checks the `notificationsEnabled` field for each recipient:

```typescript
const notificationsEnabled = userData.notificationsEnabled !== false;
if (
  userData.pushToken &&
  Expo.isExpoPushToken(userData.pushToken) &&
  notificationsEnabled // <-- This check was missing in deployed version
) {
  pushTokens.push(userData.pushToken);
}
```

**Default Behavior:** If `notificationsEnabled` is not set, defaults to `true` (backward compatible)

### Deployment Details

**Command:** `firebase deploy --only functions`

**Output:**
```
‚úî  functions[sendMessageNotification(us-central1)] Successful update operation.
‚úî  Deploy complete!
```

**Location:** `us-central1` (same as Firestore region)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Measurement | Target | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Notification latency (foreground) | <1 second | <2s | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Notification latency (background) | <2 seconds | <5s | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Deep link navigation | Instant | <1s | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Group notification fanout | <3 seconds | <5s | ‚úÖ Excellent |

## Known Limitations (Not Affecting MVP)

### 1. Badge Count Hardcoded
**Status:** Known limitation, not critical for MVP

**Current:** Badge always shows "1"
**Ideal:** Calculate actual unread count per user

**To Implement (Phase 6):**
- Track unread count per user per conversation in Firestore
- Sum total unread across all conversations
- Pass actual count to Cloud Function
- Cloud Function sets badge to actual count

### 2. No Active Conversation Suppression
**Status:** Optional enhancement, not in MVP scope

**Current:** User receives notification even if viewing the conversation
**Ideal:** Suppress notification if user is actively in the conversation

**To Implement (Phase 6):**
- Track "active conversation" in RTDB per user
- Cloud Function checks if recipient is viewing conversation
- Skip notification if active
- Clear active status on app background/close

### 3. No Badge Clear on App Open
**Status:** Optional enhancement, not critical

**Current:** Badge persists until messages are read
**Ideal:** Clear badge when app opens

**To Implement (Phase 6):**
- Call `setBadgeCount(0)` in app launch handler
- Or clear when conversation is opened

2. Message actions (copy, delete, reply)
3. Performance optimization
4. Additional testing
5. TestFlight deployment
