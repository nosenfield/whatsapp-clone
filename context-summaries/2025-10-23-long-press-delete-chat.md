# Long-Press Delete Chat Implementation

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Task:** Add long-press delete functionality to chat list  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Delete Conversation Service Function
**File:** `mobile/src/services/conversation-service.ts`

- Added `deleteConversation(conversationId: string, userId: string)` function
- Imports `deleteDoc` from Firebase Firestore
- Validates user is participant before deletion
- Completely removes conversation document from Firestore
- Includes proper error handling and logging

**Key Features:**
- Validates conversation exists
- Checks user is participant
- Handles both direct and group conversations
- Provides clear error messages

### 2. ConversationItem Component Updates
**File:** `mobile/src/components/ConversationItem.tsx`

- Added optional `onLongPress` prop to interface
- Updated component to accept and use `onLongPress` handler
- Added `onLongPress` handler to TouchableOpacity component

**Changes:**
```typescript
interface ConversationItemProps {
  conversation: Conversation;
  currentUserId: string;
  onPress: (conversationId: string) => void;
  onLongPress?: (conversationId: string) => void; // NEW
}
```

### 3. Chats Screen Long-Press Handler
**File:** `mobile/app/(tabs)/chats.tsx`

- Added `Alert` import for confirmation dialog
- Imported `deleteConversation` service function
- Created `handleConversationLongPress` function
- Added confirmation dialog with conversation name
- Integrated error handling with user feedback
- Updated `renderConversation` to pass `onLongPress` handler

**Key Features:**
- Shows conversation name in confirmation dialog
- Handles both direct chats and group chats
- Provides "Cancel" and "Delete" options
- Shows error alert if deletion fails
- Refreshes conversation list after successful deletion

---

## User Experience

### How It Works
1. **Long-press** any chat in the conversation list
2. **Confirmation dialog** appears with conversation name
3. **Cancel** or **Delete** options available
4. **Delete** removes conversation completely
5. **List refreshes** automatically after deletion

### Confirmation Dialog
- **Title:** "Delete Chat"
- **Message:** "Are you sure you want to delete '[Chat Name]'? This action cannot be undone."
- **Options:** Cancel (default) | Delete (destructive style)

### Error Handling
- Shows error alert if deletion fails
- Provides user-friendly error message
- Maintains conversation list state on error

---

## Technical Implementation

### Service Layer
```typescript
export const deleteConversation = async (
  conversationId: string,
  userId: string
): Promise<void> => {
  // 1. Validate conversation exists
  // 2. Check user is participant
  // 3. Delete conversation document
  // 4. Handle errors gracefully
}
```

### Component Integration
```typescript
// ConversationItem receives onLongPress prop
<TouchableOpacity
  onPress={() => onPress(conversation.id)}
  onLongPress={() => onLongPress?.(conversation.id)}
>

// Chats screen passes handler
<ConversationItem
  onPress={handleConversationPress}
  onLongPress={handleConversationLongPress}
/>
```

### Confirmation Flow
```typescript
Alert.alert(
  'Delete Chat',
  `Are you sure you want to delete "${conversationName}"?`,
  [
    { text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel' },
    { 
      text: 'Delete', 
      style: 'destructive',
      onPress: async () => {
        await deleteConversation(conversationId, userId);
        refetch(); // Refresh list
      }
    }
  ]
);
```
