# Phase 5: Push Notifications - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 5 - Push Notifications  
**Status:** Complete (100%)  
**Time Invested:** ~1 hour

---

## Overview

Phase 5 implements push notifications for the WhatsApp Clone app, enabling users to receive notifications when new messages arrive even when the app is closed or backgrounded. All client-side and server-side components are now in place.

**Goal Achieved:** ✅ Users can receive push notifications for new messages with deep linking to conversations

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Notifications Service (Pre-existing, Verified)
**File:** `mobile/src/services/notifications.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Request notification permissions (iOS/Android)
- ✅ Get Expo push token
- ✅ Set up notification listeners (foreground, background, tap)
- ✅ Handle initial notification (cold start)
- ✅ Badge count management
- ✅ Local notification scheduling (testing)
- ✅ Type-safe notification data extraction
- ✅ Message notification type guard

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
registerForPushNotifications(userId: string): Promise<string | null>
setupNotificationListeners(onReceived, onTapped)
getInitialNotification(): Promise<NotificationResponse | null>
setBadgeCount(count: number)
clearAllNotifications()
```

### 2. Push Token Registration (Pre-existing, Verified)
**File:** `mobile/src/store/auth-store.ts`

**Integration Points:**
- ✅ Sign up: Register push token after account creation
- ✅ Sign in: Register push token after authentication
- ✅ App launch: Register push token on auth state restore
- ✅ Token storage: Save to Firestore `/users/{userId}/pushToken`

**registerPushToken() Flow:**
1. Call `registerForPushNotifications(userId)`
2. Get Expo push token
3. Save to Firestore with `pushTokenUpdatedAt` timestamp
4. Gracefully handle failures (don't block app usage)

### 3. Notification Listeners (Pre-existing, Verified)
**File:** `mobile/app/_layout.tsx`

**Handlers:**
- ✅ **Foreground:** Display notification banner while app is open
- ✅ **Background:** Show iOS notification when app is backgrounded
- ✅ **Cold Start:** Check for notification that opened app
- ✅ **Deep Linking:** Navigate to conversation on tap

**handleNotificationTap() Flow:**
1. Extract notification data
2. Check if it's a message notification
3. Navigate to `/conversation/{conversationId}`
4. Works on cold start and warm start

### 4. Cloud Function for Notifications (Pre-existing, Verified)
**File:** `functions/src/index.ts`

**Function:** `sendMessageNotification`
- ✅ Triggers on `/conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}` creation
- ✅ Fetches conversation and sender data
- ✅ Determines recipients (all participants except sender)
- ✅ Retrieves push tokens from Firestore
- ✅ Validates Expo push tokens
- ✅ Respects notification preferences (`notificationsEnabled`)
- ✅ Constructs notification payload
- ✅ Handles group vs. direct conversations
- ✅ Sends notifications via Expo Push API
- ✅ Batches notifications (100 per chunk)
- ✅ Logs success/error tickets

**Notification Payload:**
```typescript
{
  to: userPushToken,
  sound: "default",
  title: senderName | groupName,
  body: messageText | "📷 Image",
  data: {
    type: "new_message",
    conversationId,
    messageId,
    senderId,
    senderName,
  },
  badge: 1,
  priority: "high",
  channelId: "messages",
}
```

### 5. Notification Preferences (NEW)
**File:** `mobile/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`

**Added:**
- ✅ Toggle switch for "Push Notifications"
- ✅ Load preference from Firestore on mount
- ✅ Save preference to Firestore on toggle
- ✅ Display loading state while updating
- ✅ Revert on error with alert
- ✅ Default to enabled if not set

**User Flow:**
1. Open Profile tab
2. Toggle "Push Notifications" switch
3. Preference saved to Firestore
4. Cloud Function respects setting (won't send if disabled)

### 6. Type System Updates (NEW)
**File:** `mobile/src/types/index.ts`

**Added to User interface:**
```typescript
notificationsEnabled?: boolean; // Default: true
```

**Cloud Function Integration:**
- Checks `userData.notificationsEnabled !== false` before sending
- Defaults to `true` if field doesn't exist (backward compatible)

### 7. App Configuration (Pre-existing, Verified)
**File:** `mobile/app.json`

**Push Notification Config:**
- ✅ EAS Project ID: `23ac19e4-5829-4f79-8173-4dbf5e19bcb6`
- ✅ URL Scheme: `whatsappclone` (for deep linking)
- ✅ iOS Bundle ID: `com.nosenfield.whatsappclone`
- ✅ expo-notifications plugin configured

## Architecture

### Notification Flow

**When User A sends message to User B:**

1. **Message Created:**
   - User A sends message
   - Message document created in `/conversations/{id}/messages/{msgId}`

2. **Cloud Function Triggered:**
   - `sendMessageNotification` function executes
   - Fetches conversation and sender data
   - Identifies recipients (User B)
   - Retrieves User B's push token
   - Checks `notificationsEnabled` preference

3. **Notification Sent:**
   - Constructs Expo push message
   - Sends via Expo Push API
   - Expo delivers to APNs (iOS)
   - APNs delivers to User B's device

4. **Client Receives:**
   - **Foreground:** Banner shown via notification listener
   - **Background:** iOS system notification appears
   - **Tap:** App opens and navigates to conversation

5. **Deep Linking:**
   - Extract `conversationId` from notification data
   - Navigate to `/conversation/{conversationId}`
   - Message appears in conversation view

### Group Notifications

**When message sent to group:**

1. **Fanout to Multiple Recipients:**
   - Cloud Function identifies all participants except sender
   - Fetches push tokens for all recipients
   - Filters by `notificationsEnabled` preference
   - Batches into chunks of 100 (Expo limit)

2. **Notification Content:**
   - Title: Group name
   - Body: "SenderName: Message text"
   - Data: Same structure as direct messages

3. **Delivery:**
   - All group members receive notification simultaneously
   - Each can tap to open group conversation

## Testing Requirements

### ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Physical Device Required:**
   - Push notifications DO NOT work on iOS Simulator
   - Must test on actual iPhone
   - Simulator gracefully skips registration

   - Could track active conversation in RTDB

3. **Notification Sounds:** Uses iOS default
   - TODO: Custom notification sound
   - Add sound file to assets

4. **Rich Notifications:** Basic text only
   - TODO: Show image thumbnails in notification
   - Requires iOS notification service extension

5. **Notification History:** Not persisted
   - TODO: Store notification history in Firestore
   - Allow users to view past notifications

---

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- ✅ Batched sending (100 notifications per chunk)
- ✅ Async/await for non-blocking execution
- ✅ Efficient Firestore queries (single query for all recipients)
- ✅ Token validation before sending

### Cost Optimization
- ✅ Only send to users with valid tokens
- ✅ Respect notification preferences (skip disabled users)
- ✅ Single Cloud Function invocation per message
- ✅ No redundant Firestore reads

### Error Handling
