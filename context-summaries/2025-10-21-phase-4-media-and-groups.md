# Context Summary: Phase 4 - Media & Group Chat

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Session Duration:** ~1.5 hours  
**Phase:** Phase 4 - Media & Group Chat  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (100%)

---

## Overview

Phase 4 has been successfully implemented, adding **image messaging** and **group chat functionality** to the WhatsApp clone. Users can now:
- Send and receive images with captions
- Create groups with up to 20 members
- Send messages in group conversations
- See sender names in group messages
- View group information in conversation headers

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Image Upload & Display (Pre-existing - Verified Complete)

The image upload functionality was already implemented from previous work:

**✅ Components:**
- `MessageInput.tsx` - Image picker button (camera + library)
- `MessageBubble.tsx` - Image display with loading states
- `image-service.ts` - Upload, compression, thumbnail generation

**✅ Features:**
- Camera and photo library access
- Image compression (max 10MB)
- Thumbnail generation (200x200)
- Upload to Firebase Storage
- Optimistic UI (shows local image immediately)
- Caption support
- Loading indicators
- Error handling

**Files Modified:**
- Already complete, no changes needed

---

### 2. New Group Screen

Created a dedicated screen for group creation with member selection.

**New File:** `mobile/app/new-group.tsx`

**Features:**
- Group name input with placeholder icon
- Search users by email
- Multi-select user interface
- Selected members displayed as chips (blue pills)
- Member count display (X/20)
- Enforces minimum 2 members
- Enforces maximum 20 members (MAX_GROUP_SIZE)
- "Create" button in header (disabled until requirements met)
- iOS ActionSheet for selection
- Loading overlay during creation
- Auto-navigates to new group after creation

**UI Elements:**
- Group icon placeholder (blue with group icon)
- Horizontal scrollable list of selected members
- Search bar at bottom (same pattern as new-conversation)
- Member counter: "Members: 3/20"
- Remove member button (X) on each chip
- Empty state prompts

---

### 3. Group Creation Logic

Extended conversation service to support group conversation creation.

**File Modified:** `mobile/src/services/conversation-service.ts`

**New Function:** `createGroupConversation(creatorId, participantIds, groupName)`

**Logic:**
1. Validates participant count (2-20 members)
2. Ensures creator is in participant list
3. Fetches details for all participants
4. Creates conversation document with:
   - `type: 'group'`
   - `name: groupName`
   - `participants: [array of user IDs]`
   - `participantDetails: { userId: { displayName, photoURL } }`
   - `createdBy: creatorId`
   - `createdAt: timestamp`
   - `unreadCount: { userId: 0 }`
5. Returns conversation ID

**Error Handling:**
- Validates minimum members
- Validates maximum members
- Checks creator is included
- Handles failed user lookups
- Throws descriptive errors

---

### 4. Navigation to Group Creation

Updated chats screen to add navigation to group creation.

**File Modified:** `mobile/app/(tabs)/chats.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added iOS ActionSheet when FAB is pressed
- Options: "Cancel", "New Conversation", "New Group"
- Routes to `/new-group` when "New Group" selected
- Android fallback (currently routes to new-conversation)

**User Flow:**
1. User taps FAB (+) button
2. Action sheet appears
3. Select "New Group"
4. Navigate to group creation screen

---

### 5. Conversation List Group Support

Updated conversation list items to display groups properly.

**File Modified:** `mobile/src/components/ConversationItem.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Display Name Logic:**
   - Groups: Show group name
   - Direct: Show other participant name
   - Fallback: "Group Chat" or "Unknown"

2. **Avatar Icon:**
   - Groups: Green avatar with "group" icon
   - Direct: Blue avatar with "person" icon
   
3. **Online Indicator:**
   - Groups: No online indicator (not applicable)
   - Direct: Green dot if user online

4. **Last Message Preview:**
   - Groups: Show sender name prefix ("John: Hello!")
   - Groups: Show "You: " for own messages
   - Direct: Just show message text
   - Image messages: "📷 Image" or "John: 📷 Image"

**Styles Added:**
- `groupAvatar` - Green background (#34C759)

---

### 6. Conversation Screen Group Support

Updated conversation screen to handle groups in header and UI.

**File Modified:** `mobile/app/conversation/[id].tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Header Title:**
   - Groups: Show group name
   - Direct: Show participant name

2. **Header Subtitle:**
   - Groups: "X members" (e.g., "5 members")
   - Direct: "online" or "last seen X ago"

3. **Presence Subscription:**
   - Only subscribe to presence for direct chats
   - No presence checks for groups

4. **Variables Updated:**
   - `isGroup` - Boolean flag
   - `conversationName` - Dynamic based on type
   - `otherParticipantId` - Only for direct chats
   - `headerSubtitle` - Dynamic based on type

**Passed to MessageList:**
- Added `conversation` prop to enable sender display

---

### 7. Message List Group Support

Updated message list to pass group context to message bubbles.

**File Modified:** `mobile/src/components/MessageList.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added `conversation` prop (optional)
2. Determine if conversation is a group
3. Pass `showSender={isGroup}` to MessageBubble
4. Pass `conversation` to MessageBubble

**Logic:**
- If group → show sender names
- If direct → hide sender names (redundant)

---

### 8. Message Bubble Sender Display

Message bubbles already had sender display support built in.

**File:** `mobile/src/components/MessageBubble.tsx` (no changes needed)

**Existing Features:**
- `showSender` prop (when true, shows sender name)
- `conversation` prop (provides participant details)
- Displays sender name above message bubble
- Only shows for messages from others (not own messages)
- Falls back to "Unknown" if sender details missing

---

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Group Conversation Model

**Firestore Structure:**
```typescript
/conversations/{conversationId}
{
  type: 'group',
  name: 'My Group',
  participants: ['userId1', 'userId2', 'userId3'],
  participantDetails: {
    userId1: { displayName: 'John', photoURL: '...' },
    userId2: { displayName: 'Jane', photoURL: '...' },
    userId3: { displayName: 'Bob', photoURL: '...' }
  },
  createdBy: 'userId1',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  lastMessageAt: Timestamp,
  lastMessage: { ... },
  unreadCount: {
    userId1: 0,
    userId2: 2,
    userId3: 1
  }
}
```

**Why This Structure:**
- `type` field allows easy filtering (direct vs group)
- `participants` array enables Firestore `array-contains` queries
- `participantDetails` denormalized for fast display (no extra lookups)
- `createdBy` tracks group creator (future: admin permissions)
- `name` field only exists for groups
- `unreadCount` per user (future: per-user tracking)

### 2. Group Size Limit

**Constant:** `MAX_GROUP_SIZE = 20`

**Enforced At:**
1. UI - Button disabled at limit
2. Service - Validation throws error
3. Firestore rules (future enhancement)

**Rationale:**
- WhatsApp limits groups to 256, but starting smaller
- 20 is manageable for MVP testing
- Easy to increase later if needed
- Reduces Firebase read costs during testing

### 3. Member Selection UX

**Pattern: Chip-based Selection**

**Why:**
- Visual confirmation of selected members
- Easy to remove members (tap X)
- Horizontal scroll prevents vertical space issues
- Familiar pattern (iOS Contacts, Messages)
- Shows count without expanding

**Alternative Considered:**
- Checkboxes in list (takes more space)
- Modal selection (extra navigation step)

### 4. Group Icon Color

**Choice: Green (#34C759)**

**Why:**
- Differentiates from direct chats (blue)
- iOS system green (consistent with design language)
- Associated with "groups" in many apps
- High contrast against white background

### 5. Sender Name Display

**Groups:** Always show sender name above bubble  
**Direct:** Never show sender name (redundant)

**Placement:** Above bubble, left-aligned, gray text

**Why:**
- Essential for groups (who said what)
- Redundant in direct chats (only one other person)
- Above bubble (not inside) maintains bubble clarity
- Gray color (#8E8E93) - subtle, not distracting

## Technical Implementation Details

### Group Creation Flow

```typescript
1. User completes form → handleCreateGroup()
2. Validation: ≥2 members, name not empty
3. Build participant array: [currentUser.id, ...selectedUsers]
4. Call createGroupConversation(creatorId, participants, name)
5. Service validates: 2-20 members, creator included
6. Fetch participant details from Firestore
7. Build participantDetails object
8. Create conversation document
9. Return conversationId
10. Navigate to /conversation/{conversationId}
11. Conversation screen loads group
12. Shows group name + member count in header
13. Ready to send messages
```

### Message Display in Groups

```typescript
1. MessageList receives conversation prop
2. Check: isGroup = conversation.type === 'group'
3. Pass to MessageBubble: showSender={isGroup}
4. MessageBubble checks showSender:
   - If true && !isOwnMessage:
     - Get sender name from conversation.participantDetails
     - Display name above bubble
   - If false: No sender name
5. Render message content as usual
```

### Conversation List Group Display

```typescript
1. ConversationItem receives conversation
2. Check: isGroup = conversation.type === 'group'
3. Display name:
   - Group: conversation.name
   - Direct: otherParticipant.displayName
4. Avatar:
   - Group: Green with 'group' icon
   - Direct: Blue with 'person' icon
5. Online indicator:
   - Group: Hidden (not applicable)
   - Direct: Show if online
6. Last message:
   - Group: "SenderName: Message text"
   - Direct: "Message text"
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

Since I cannot test with real devices, here's what needs to be tested:

#### Group Creation
- [ ] Create group with 2 members (minimum)
- [ ] Create group with 10 members (mid-range)
- [ ] Create group with 20 members (maximum)
- [ ] Try to create with 21 members (should show error)
- [ ] Try to create with 1 member (should show error)
- [ ] Try to create without group name (Create button disabled)
- [ ] Search and add members works correctly
- [ ] Remove member from selected list works
- [ ] Member count updates correctly (X/20)
- [ ] Group appears in conversation list after creation

#### Group Messaging
- [ ] Send text message in group (User A)
- [ ] User B receives message and sees sender name
- [ ] User C receives message and sees sender name
- [ ] Send image in group
- [ ] All members receive image
- [ ] Image message shows sender name
- [ ] Typing indicators work in groups (Phase 3 feature)
- [ ] Multiple users typing at once

#### Group UI
- [ ] Group icon is green in conversation list
- [ ] Group name displays correctly in list
- [ ] Last message shows sender name ("John: Hello")

- [ ] No online indicator on group items
- [ ] Group header shows name
- [ ] Group header shows "X members"
- [ ] Sender names appear above messages
- [ ] Own messages don't show sender name

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Group with long name (truncates properly)
- [ ] Group with member who has long name
- [ ] Leave group (future feature - not implemented)
- [ ] Add/remove members (future feature - not implemented)
- [ ] Group info screen (future feature - not implemented)

## Known Limitations

### Not Implemented Yet (Future Enhancements)

1. **Group Management:**
   - Cannot add members after creation
   - Cannot remove members
   - Cannot leave group
   - Cannot delete group
   - No admin/permissions system
   - Cannot change group name
   - Cannot add group photo

2. **Group Info Screen:**
   - No dedicated group info view
   - Cannot tap header to see member list
   - Cannot see who's in the group after creation

3. **Read Receipts for Groups:**
   - Currently showing basic status
   - Not showing "Read by X/Y members"
   - Cannot see list of who read

4. **Notifications:**
   - Push notifications not yet tested for groups
   - May need special handling for group mentions

5. **Search/Discovery:**
   - Cannot search existing groups
   - Cannot join public groups (no such concept)

6. **Media:**
   - Group photos not implemented
   - Cannot set group icon

### Technical Debt

1. **Participant Details Denormalization:**
   - Stored at conversation creation
   - Not updated if user changes displayName
   - Future: Add Cloud Function to sync updates

2. **Group Size:**
   - Hardcoded at 20 members
   - Should be configurable
   - Consider tiered limits (free vs paid)

3. **Validation:**
   - Firestore rules don't enforce group size
   - Only enforced in client code
   - Should add server-side validation

4. **Android Support:**
   - Currently falls back to new-conversation
   - Should implement Android action menu
   - Or use Modal instead of ActionSheet

---

## Performance Considerations

### Queries

1. **Group Creation:**
   - N participant detail fetches (sequential)
   - Could be optimized with batch read
   - Acceptable for 20 users (< 1 second)

2. **Conversation List:**
   - Each group loads full participant details
   - Denormalized data = fast display
   - No additional queries needed

3. **Message Display:**
   - Sender details already in conversation
   - No per-message lookups
   - Efficient for large groups

### Firebase Costs

1. **Group Creation:**
   - 1 write (conversation document)
   - N reads (participant details)
   - One-time cost

2. **Group Messaging:**
   - Same cost as direct chat
   - 1 write per message
   - N members notified via listeners (free)
   - Firestore charged per document, not per listener

3. **Presence:**
   - Groups don't use presence
   - No additional RTDB costs

---

## Security Rules

### Current Implementation

Groups are created client-side with the following data:
- `type: 'group'`
- `name: string`
- `participants: string[]`
- `participantDetails: object`
- `createdBy: string`

### Firestore Rules Needed

```javascript
// conversations collection
match /conversations/{conversationId} {
  allow create: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid in request.resource.data.participants
    && (
      (request.resource.data.type == 'direct' && 
       request.resource.data.participants.size() == 2)
      ||
      (request.resource.data.type == 'group' && 
       request.resource.data.participants.size() >= 2 &&
       request.resource.data.participants.size() <= 20 &&
       request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid)
    );
    
  allow read: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;
    
  allow update: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;
    
  // Messages subcollection
  match /messages/{messageId} {
    allow create: if request.auth != null 
      && request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/conversations/$(conversationId)).data.participants
      && request.resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid;
      
    allow read: if request.auth != null 
      && request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/conversations/$(conversationId)).data.participants;
  }
}
```

**Note:** These rules should be added to `firestore.rules` file.
